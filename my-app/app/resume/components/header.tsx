        I am a Computer Engineering student at Chulalongkorn University. My
        academic and extracurricular journey has shaped my analytical thinking
        and fueled my passion for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and
        data science. I am driven to explore innovative solutions that integrate
        technology with real-world applications, particularly at the
        intersection of business, economics, technology, and investment. Outside
        my technical pursuits, I enjoy photography and engaging in discussions
        about philosophy, history, and politics, to broaden my perspective and
        inspire creative problem-solving.
